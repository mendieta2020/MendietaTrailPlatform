- Computes CTL/ATL/TSB from CompletedActivity
- Core scientific feature
- Risk: Low-Medium

### PR-129 — Historical backfill pipeline
- Celery task to pull historical Strava activities
- Risk: Medium

## Billing Architecture Summary

```
Quantoryn B2B: Coach pays Quantoryn (OrganizationSubscription)
Coach B2C:     Athlete pays Coach via MercadoPago (AthleteSubscription)
```

### Models built
- `OrganizationSubscription` — plan tier, trial, is_active
- `SubscriptionPlan` — configurable pricing (admin), mp_plan_id
- `CoachPricingPlan` — coach's pricing for athletes, price_ars
- `AthleteSubscription` — athlete→coach plan, status lifecycle
- `OrgOAuthCredential` — org-scoped OAuth credential (coach MP account)
- `AthleteInvitation` — token-based invite (PR-135), 30-day expiry, owner/admin only

### Integrations built
- `integrations/mercadopago/client.py` — mp_get/post/put
- `integrations/mercadopago/subscriptions.py` — create/get/cancel + create_coach_athlete_preapproval (PR-135)
- `integrations/mercadopago/webhook.py` — process_subscription_webhook (idempotent)
- `integrations/mercadopago/oauth.py` — mp_get_authorization_url + mp_exchange_code

### What's missing to complete billing loop
1. ~~Coach MP OAuth (PR-134)~~ ✅ DONE
2. ~~Athlete invite + preapproval (PR-135)~~ ✅ DONE
3. AthleteSubscription webhook handler (PR-136)

## Technical Debt
- FINDING-X4-A: ExternalIdentityViewSet legacy scope (low priority)
- Migration 0083 uses atomic=False (standard pattern for PostgreSQL FK+DDL)
- PR-132 was merged directly to main (no feature branch) — process gap corrected
- PR-134: OrgOAuthCredential uses fresh org instance in tests to avoid cached reverse OneToOne from post_save signal

## Key Technical Decisions
- atomic=False: standard for any migration combining DDL + DML on FK tables
- Lazy imports: Law 4 compliance for integrations/ imports in core/
- PASO 0 mandatory: all future prompts must start with branch creation
- transaction=True on IntegrityError tests: PostgreSQL aborts tx on violations

## Test Baseline
~1252+ tests (14 added in PR-135) | CI: backend ✅ frontend ✅
